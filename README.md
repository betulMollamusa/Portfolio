# Portfolio
The "Personal Portfolio Information" project is a web application that allows users to enter and save their own portfolio details. The project consists of two separate pages: "Customize" and "Portfolio."

On the "Customize" page, users can input their names, general information about themselves, contact details, and add the projects they have worked on or participated in. There is a specific field provided to enter the names of projects and their corresponding links. Users can add projects by clicking the "Add" button and save all the information by clicking the "Save" button after entering other details.

On the "Portfolio" page, users' personal information and projects are displayed in a list format. Users can click on the project names to access their corresponding links. Additionally, users can update their information by clicking the "Customize" button to return to the "Customize" page.

The project aims to facilitate the management and update of professional and personal projects for users, making it easier for them to maintain and showcase their portfolio information.
